# trellotimer
This Pomodoro timer helps you stay focused while executing your Trello Tasks.
This application allows to:

* Connect to your Trello lists and choose three of them as TODO, DOING and DONE lists.

* Move tasks bewteen these lists.

* Choose a card (the task) in the DOING list and start a Pomodoro (30 minutes).

* Register the time and pomodoros that a task is taking to complete, and log it as a card comment once it is finished.

* Take long or short breaks (15 or 5 minutes).

Implemented with Android Studio (project files included), tested in a Nexus 4 device. Developed as exercise on Android development in TDD. Used Robolectric for unit tests. In this case no dependency injection engine was used, but I recommend Dagger.

The sound used in the app was obtained from:
